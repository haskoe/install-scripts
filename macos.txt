cargo-make, cargo-watch, cargo-edit, cargo-audit and cargo-tarpaulin to be useful. I make use of the first two every day. And how about something similar: rusty-hook which totally isn't a cargo plugin but does have some cargo integration by working as a dev-dependency. Although I understand that audit and git-hook support are also offered as part of cargo-checkmate which I am only now discovering thanks to this post.
